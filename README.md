#Tripix

This is a project using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3 and Capybara testing. It's a simple photo journal app where a user can log in, add new adventures, and upload pictures. Just in case it's helpful, the user's profile page can be accessed by clicking their username located in the top right (when they are logged in).
